## What is BetSnipe.ai?

BetSnipe.ai is a real-time sports betting analytics platform that monitors odds from multiple bookmakers simultaneously, identifies profitable opportunities, and delivers instant alerts to users via a mobile app.

Think of it as a "price comparison engine" for sports betting — but instead of comparing product prices, we compare betting odds across bookmakers to find the best value for bettors.

## The Problem

### For Bettors:
- **Time-consuming** — Manually checking odds across 7+ bookmakers takes hours
- **Missed opportunities** — Odds change every few seconds; by the time you find a good bet, it's gone
- **Information overload** — Thousands of matches, dozens of bet types, impossible to track manually
- **No guaranteed profits** — Traditional betting always favors the bookmaker

### The Market Reality:
- Serbian betting market has 10+ licensed bookmakers
- Each bookmaker sets their own odds independently
- Price differences (inefficiencies) exist but disappear within minutes
- Only professionals with expensive tools can exploit these opportunities

## Key Features

### 1. Arbitrage Detection
**What is arbitrage?** A situation where you can bet on ALL outcomes of an event across different bookmakers and guarantee a profit regardless of the result.

**Example:**
- Bookmaker A offers Team 1 to win at 2.10
- Bookmaker B offers Team 2 to win at 2.05
- By betting the right amounts on both, you profit 2-3% guaranteed

BetSnipe.ai automatically detects these opportunities and calculates the exact stakes needed.

### 2. Best Odds Finder
For any match, instantly see which bookmaker offers the highest odds for your chosen bet. Even a difference of 0.05 in odds can mean 5% more profit over time.

### 3. Real-Time Alerts
- Push notifications for arbitrage opportunities
- Customizable filters (minimum profit %, sports, bookmakers)
- Watchlist for specific matches

### 4. Odds Movement Tracking
